Machine Learning Concepts Study Guide

Supervised Learning:
1. Classification
   - Predicts categories/classes
   - Examples: email spam detection, image recognition
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
   - Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

2. Regression
   - Predicts continuous values
   - Examples: house prices, stock prices
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest
   - Evaluation: MSE, MAE, R-squared

Unsupervised Learning:
1. Clustering
   - Groups similar data points
   - Examples: customer segmentation, gene sequencing
   - Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering
   - Evaluation: Silhouette score, Elbow method

2. Dimensionality Reduction
   - Reduces feature space while preserving information
   - Examples: visualization, compression
   - Algorithms: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP

Data Preprocessing:
- Feature scaling: StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler
- Handling missing values: imputation, removal
- Encoding categorical variables: one-hot, label encoding
- Feature selection: correlation analysis, feature importance

Model Evaluation:
- Train/Validation/Test split
- Cross-validation
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Overfitting vs. underfitting
- Learning curves

Key Algorithms:
1. Linear Regression
   - Simple, interpretable
   - Assumes linear relationship
   - Good baseline model

2. Random Forest
   - Ensemble of decision trees
   - Handles non-linear relationships
   - Built-in feature importance

3. Neural Networks
   - Deep learning for complex patterns
   - Requires large datasets
   - Black box but powerful

Python Libraries:
- scikit-learn: General ML algorithms
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: Deep learning
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting
- pandas: Data manipulation
- matplotlib/seaborn: Visualization
